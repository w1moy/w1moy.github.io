            <h3>History of Louisville</h3>
            <p>The town of Louisville was started when the Welch Mine was opened in August of 1877 and Louis Nawatny
                platted his farm land into the town he named for himself, Louisville. Nawatny registered his plat in
                February 1878. Coal miners move to the new town were they could live in town and walk to work at the
                Welch Mine. Which was different than most mining towns. There were 30 mines that opened in and around
                Louisville. During the peak years of 1907 to 1909 there were 12 mines in operation. After World War II
                the use of coal declined and the last mine closed in 1952.

                Many Europeans migrated to Louisville to work in the mines. Now people migrate to Louisville to enjoy a
                middle-class haven where they enjoy 275 days of sunshine a year. Were they can play tennis, catch a
                round of golf, enjoy an afternoon in the park, or walk the many trail throughout the city year round.
